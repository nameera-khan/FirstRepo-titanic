As a beginner to the vastness of data science, this is my first Exploratory data analysis project. The 'titanic' dataset, I realise, is commonly used for data analysis time and again. However, using this dataset did give me (since this is my first project) the necessary insights into how the workflow progresses in an analytical division. 
The dataset utilised in this project consists of 418 fields of each passenger onboard the Titanic. Each variable in the dataset imparts details of the passengers' name, ticket number, survival, room-class, number of family members on board, destination embarked from and the cabin number. 
However, the data missing in the 'cabin number' column is higher. A plethora of theories can be speculated for the same, however, it does depend on how we view the data at hand.
